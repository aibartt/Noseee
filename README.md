## Project Description

## Overview
Noseee is an online real-time collaborative application where people can create their own drawings using their nose movements. The project uses Socket.io for realtime multiplayer connections, ML5 client-side javascript library for identifyng the coordinates of nose position by PoseNet and WebRTC for streaming the videos of players. Users can choose the color of the  brush by clicking numbers on keyboard and clean the drawing space with "c" keypress.

## Idea, Concept and Inspiration

I decided to try something new and create a project using p5 and ml5 client side javascript libraries. The idea was to create a colloborative application where different users could contribute in some way to the common form of art or composition. After some brainstorming I thought that creating a app which stimulates some physical activity would be a good idea. But dragging the mouse is not a big deal, right? I need something more interesting and maybe useful. As a CS major I use my laptop for more than 10 hours every day. Unsurprisingly, I started to experience neck and back pain because of countless hours staring at a computer screen. Naturally, you will begin to experience fatigue staying in the same position for hours, which then leads to bad posture and a strain on your cervical vertebrae. This is the cause of upper back and neck pain, sore shoulders and even lumbar pain in your lower back. Millions of other people acrooss the world experience the same symptoms but not everyone can notice it and take decisive actions to confront it. That's how I came acrooss the idea of using the users's nose position to draw on this application. Noseee will not only be an entertaining break for users but will also stimulate their neck muscles with physical activity.
